# RESTConf Using Python Demo

This repository was created and intended to be used in the ENAUTO Study group presentation on RESTconf.

The demo scripts and supporting data are intended to be used on the Programmability Foundations Lab environment.  This doesn't preclude you from modifying the attributes to work in some other environment.

## Steps

The walk-through steps can be found in docs [here](docs/python_restconf.md)
